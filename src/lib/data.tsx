        The Journey Within is made up of an amazing team of practitioners that
        are passionate about helping people heal. Through their ketamine
        assisted therapy, they continually do all they can to help their
        patients reach new levels of healing and peace. With a shared belief in
        the mind and body connection, we have decided to partner and offer
        packages that combine the healing power of ketamine assisted therapy and
        massage. Our bodies hold stress and trauma within them. When we heal our
        minds, we simultaneously can help our bodies to release pain and heal as
        well. Let massage help your body release the stress and trauma itâ€™s
        holding, and call The Journey Within to book your Ketamine assisted
        therapy with massage today!
